Spanner Async Client
====================

* Introduction
This is a Google Cloud Spanner Client Library written to deal with the lack of
Async pattern support in the standard library set. This library also allows the
ability to stream results, better control of SessionPool semantics and uses a
Cursor model for processing the results.
